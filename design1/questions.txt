Don't make me think!   APIs should be easy to remember without reference
material.

Arguments:

  ordinal arguments
    - how many ordinal arguments before it gets overwhelming

  keyword args
    - what are the advantages of pseudokeyword arguments?
    - disadvantages "" ?
      - when is this technique (not?) better for optional arguments?

  arguments as array
    - when is this useful?
    - what are the downsides?
    - how would you document this?  (#call-seq)

Blocks:

  - what are some problems that can happen as a result of all Ruby methods
    accepting blocks whether or not they've been called?
    - Way to protect against it:  raise if block_given?   Evil?  Overkill?  Why?

    - this can result in false positives:

      my_method do |x|
        assert_equal "foo", x
      end

      What is a better way to test?


  - arity of lambda { }  (-1 on Ruby 1.8.  0 on Ruby 1.9)
