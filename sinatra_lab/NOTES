== Sinatra code-reading exercise

* Testing framework and tests
  - What testing framework does Sinatra use?
    * Basically Test::Unit. (Rakefile: rake/testtask, task :default => :test...)
    - Where does the +it+ method come from?
      * Look in any of the test files. They require "helper". So look in
        helper.rb. "alias_method :it, :test"
    - OK, then where does +test+ come from? That's not vanilla Test::Unit.
      * show use of +ack+ for code pickaxeing
        $ ack "def self.test"
    > test/contest.rb
      - What is the +self.context+ method doing, in Test::Unit terms?
        * Sets up a new Test::Unit::TestCase subclass, prepends all of the
          existing setup methods, and evaluates the given block within.
        * Almost all of the benefit of Contest is that it allows nested contexts
          by prepending the setup_blocks upon subclassing.
        * Note: "magic" Class#name; the const_set() has action-at-a-distance
            i = Class.new
            MyClass = i
            i.name # => "MyClass"
  > test/base_test.rb
    - Why are the examples interleaved with the class definition?
      * No reason, just readability. This is more of a discussion question.
      - Does it matter that the class definition is broken up?
      - Is the test code run during or after the execution of base_test.rb?
        - What actually happens immediately when an +it+ block is run?
        * All of the class definitions run at load time; there's no reason they
          have to be interleaved like that.
  - How does "assert ok?" or "assert redirect?" work?
    > test/helper.rb: method_missing delegates to +response+.
  > test/routing_test.rb
    - Routes can take conditions. How does this work?
        user_agent(/Foo/)
        get '/foo' do
          'foo'
        end

        get '/foo' do
          'not foo'
        end
      * +condition+ just pushes on to @conditions. 
      * @conditions is saved and cleared during each call to +route+.
        > base.rb:799
          conditions, @conditions = @conditions, []
        * diversion: parallel assignment, destructuring?
  > test/route_added_hook_test.rb
    - What role does RouteAddedTest play?
      * Just a mock of sorts for testing extensions.
  - Anything that jumps out at you? Poll group for discussion.
* General
  * Note the combined getters / setters: (base.rb:60)
      def status(value=nil)
        response.status = value if value
        response.status
      end
  - Routes, along with other options, are passed down from superclass to
    subclass. How does this work? 
    * Completely manually. (This is more of a code excavation exercise --
      just to show how to *find* this. There's nothing magical about how this
      functionality actually works.)
  - What is the purpose of this bit of convoluted code? (base.rb:67)
      def body(value=nil, &block)
        if block_given?
          def block.each ; yield call ; end
          response.body = block
        else
          response.body = value
        end
      end
      * Just to comply with the Rack interface that says a body must respond to
        #each. You can pass a block to +body+ and defer evaluation until the
        response is actually read.
  - What is required to write and register an extension with Sinatra? Can you
    describe the extension API just by reading the code?
    > base.rb:855 et al. -- just a module, nothing specific. Optional imeths
      implement hook callbacks. Sinatra calls #registered(self) when the module
      is registered.
  - How do the ivars get passed through to the renderer?
      get "/" do
        @text = "Hello, world!"
        haml %{%p= @text}
      end
    * Everything gloms onto the same object. The view is the renderer. Only
      small shims required to pull the current binding into ERb, etc.
    * Showing the benefits of keeping everything inside the same object. Rails
      has a bunch of plumbing to shuttle bindings around, so that you get the
      variables you want, where you want. Sinatra is small enough that it just
      evaluates everything inside the same object.
  * Poll for suggestions, interesting code, etc. --v
  * Freakin' sweet: Sinatra::Base#forward (using modular Sinatra app as Rack
    middleware).

* Plumbing
  - A Sinatra app can be really simple. What makes this start a server?
      # my_app.rb
      require 'sinatra'
      get('/') { "Hello, World!" }
    * Look in sinatra.rb. Requiring 'sinatra' pulls in 'sinatra/main', which
      does some option processing and sets an at_exit callback if $0 (program
      being run) == caller_files.first (requirer of 'sinatra').
      This is "__FILE__ == $0" one level removed.
    - When this syntax is used, what actually happens at the modular Sinatra
      level? In other words, where / how is the actual Sinatra app created?
      * Sinatra::Delegator is mixed into main. This exposes the DSL and the
        helpers at the toplevel, and they delegate to Sinatra::Application.
      - Since "require 'sinatra'" in a Ruby file starts a server using the
        "classic" Sinatra interface, why doesn't it start a server when required
        directly from irb?
        * The at_exit run! only works if the file requiring 'sinatra' is the
          file currently being run ($0). Under irb, $0 is "irb".
  - How does Sinatra know what server to run? (Mongrel, Thin, ...)
    * Cheating: It just uses Rack::Handler. You can specify with -s (main.rb)
  - Why does +Sinatra::Base#call+ dup itself and then call #call! ? (base.rb:360)
    * So that the app can be called from Rack multiple times. The app is 
      allowed to munge its environment, and since it's working on a clean copy
      it can scribble on params, env, request, response, etc. all it wants and
      Rack can still dispatch anew.
